## **Implemented Models**

1. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN):**  
   - Standard CNN architectures applied to image classification tasks.  
   - Explored layer stacking, pooling, and dropout techniques for better generalization.

2. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Variants:**  
   - Implemented vanilla RNNs for sequence data processing.  
   - Experimented with LSTMs and GRUs to address vanishing gradient issues.

3. **Autoencoders:**  
   - Built variational autoencoders for feature extraction.  
   - Experimented with latent space visualizations and regularization techniques.
     
4. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN):**  
   - Developed basic GANs for generating synthetic images.  
   - Explored improvements with WGANs (weight clipping) and WGAN-GP (gradient penalty).

5. **Control Net:**  
   - WIP
